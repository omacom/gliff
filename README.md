# gliff

[![CI](https://github.com/omacom/gliff/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/omacom/gliff/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

gliff is a remote desktop for Hyprland. It shows the Hyprland session of
another machine in a window on yours, and all it needs between the two is
ssh: no open ports, no accounts, no relay.

Text stays sharp. Most remote desktops send video with halved colour
resolution, which blurs coloured text; gliff sends full-resolution colour
(4:4:4) through the H.264 hardware every GPU has. Video runs on the GPU at
both ends, and falls back to the CPU on machines where it cannot.

## What you get

- Mirror any screen of the remote machine, or get a private screen that
  exists only for your session and follows the size of your window.
- Your keyboard layout, not the remote's: keys map the same on both ends.
- A shared clipboard in both directions: text, images, and copied files.
- Quality that adapts to the link, giving up frame rate before sharpness.
- Reconnection when the link drops.
- A window that follows your Omarchy theme.

## Requirements

- Hyprland on both machines, with a session running on the remote one.
- ssh access from your machine to the remote one.
- For GPU video: an AMD or Intel GPU with its Vulkan and VA-API drivers
  (on Arch, `vulkan-radeon` and `mesa` for AMD, or `vulkan-intel` and
  `intel-media-driver` for Intel). Without them, and on NVIDIA, gliff uses
  the CPU and needs nothing extra.

## Install

Install gliff on both machines: your machine runs `gliff`, the remote one
runs `gliff-server`.

Install gliff from the [Omarchy Package Repository
(OPR)](https://github.com/omacom/omarchy-pkgs):

```
omarchy pkg add gliff
```

Then open **Gliff** from the app launcher, or run `gliff` in a terminal.

On Arch without the OPR, build and install the package from a checkout:

```
bin/install
```

To build from source, see [docs/development.md](docs/development.md).

## Use

```
gliff user@host
```

This mirrors the screen that has focus on the remote machine. To pick a
screen, or to get a private one:

```
gliff --output DP-1 user@host   # mirror a named remote screen
gliff --headless user@host      # a private remote screen, sized and
                                # scaled to this window
```

A mirrored screen keeps its own size and is fitted into the window. A private
screen follows the window as you resize it, and is removed when you
disconnect.

Every machine you connect to gets a tab in the title bar. Click a tab to
connect to that machine, or to switch to it: each connection keeps running
while you look at another, so switching is instant. Hover a tab for its
button: a stop square disconnects a running machine, and an X forgets one
that is not running. Drag the tabs to reorder them. The + after the tabs
opens the address bar; type `user@host` and press Enter to add a machine.
A bare `gliff` opens the window with a tab for each machine you have used,
and connects again to the ones that were connected when you closed it; with
no machines yet, it opens with the address bar ready.

**Keyboard.** Click the picture to send everything to the remote machine,
window-manager shortcuts included. Press `Shift+Esc` to get your own
shortcuts back. `--release-hotkey` changes that key (`ctrl+alt+q`,
`double-escape`, or `none`).

**Clipboard.** Copy on one machine and paste on the other. Nothing is sent
until you paste. A paste that takes more than a second shows its progress
with a cancel button. Pasted files are kept in `~/.cache/gliff/clipboard`.

**Slow links.** gliff measures the link and lowers the frame rate, then the
colour detail, then the resolution, and raises them again when there is
room. Two flags change the video, and you pass them to the server through
`--server-bin`: `--low-bandwidth` sends 4:2:0 colour from the start, and
`--full-chroma` keeps 4:4:4 on a server that encodes on the CPU.

```
gliff --server-bin 'gliff-server --low-bandwidth' user@host
```

## If something does not work

- Run `gliff-probe all` on each machine. It checks the compositor, the GPU
  drivers and both video paths, and prints PASS or FAIL for each.
- If ssh cannot find `gliff-server`, give its path:
  `gliff --server-bin /path/to/gliff-server user@host`.
- The server needs the remote user's running Hyprland session. If the ssh
  session does not have `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` or `WAYLAND_DISPLAY`, set them
  through `--server-bin 'env XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/run/user/1000 gliff-server'`.
- To rule out a driver problem, force the CPU on your end with
  `gliff --video cpu user@host`.
- Screens wider than 4096 pixels are streamed at a reduced size and scaled
  back up.
